# File Server

This project uses the **Socket** library in python in Order To manage a public file system.

After launching **server.py**, you can go ahead and run **client.py** which will make you choose whether you wish to create a new account or log into an existing one.

There are two types of users:
- *default users* `can create/edit/read the files that are marked as public or the files that specifically have the user as one of the collaborators/readers`;
- *admins* `have access to any files and can create/edit/read every`.

After logging in, try running `help`
